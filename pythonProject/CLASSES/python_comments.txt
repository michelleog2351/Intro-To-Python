# COMMENTS

# Used to add notes or comments to our programs
# For explanations
# As reminders to fix things
# Use it as a reminder to fix things or clear things up
# Use it to communicate things with other developers reading our code
# i.e. why we have written this code in a certain way

# Avoid being verbose and repetitive, for example, "print Sky is blue" and the next line is...
# print("Sky is blue")

# Use comments to explain why and how
# As well as when making certain assumptions for developers to understand the code better
