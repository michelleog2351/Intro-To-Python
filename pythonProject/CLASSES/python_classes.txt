# Classes
# We use classes to define new types to model real concepts (i.e. shopping cart, animal)
# Basic types include numbers, strings, boolean
# More complex types include lists and dictionaries

# How to define a new type called point

# Pascal naming convention allows the first letter of classes' names to be capitalised

# Add a colon which means we are going to define a block
# In this block we can define all the methods and functions that belong to points

# A class is the template or blueprint for creating objects
# Objects are the actual instances based on that blueprint

class Point:
    def move(self):
        print("move")

    def draw(self):
        print("draw")


# To create an object we type out the name of our class and then call it like a function,
# Let's put our object in a variable
# Now we use the dot operator after our newly defined variable "point1",
# We can see the two methods that we created in the class
# There are also a bunch of other method listed with double underscores, these are called "magic methods"

point1 = Point()

point1.x = 10
point1.y = 20
print(point1.x)
point1.draw()

# Apart from methods, these objects can also have attributes
# The attributes are like variables that belong to a particular object

# Now we can create another object
point2 = Point()
point2.x = 1
print(point2.x)
