# Constructors
# Problem: We can create Point objects without an x or y coordinate
# E.g.
# point = Point()
# print(point.x)
# We get an AttributeError: Point object has no attribute called "x"

# Solution: We need to use a constructor
# A constructor is a function that gets called at the time of creating an object (Point object)

# When creating this Point object we want to pass values for x and y coordinates .ie. 10, 20
# init is short for initialise

# Define a new function with double underscored thus creating a constructor
# the init method is called when an object is created
# self, x, y are the parameters for this method
# In the body of this method, we should read the values passed here, and use them to initialise our object
# When we pass 10, 20 (arguments) they will be used for x and y parameters
# self is a reference to the current object
# (When we create a new Point object self references that object in memory
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def move(self):
        print("move")

    def draw(self):
        print("draw")


point = Point(10, 20)
# point.x = 11 and x is updating
print(point.x)

# To change a value set point to the new vaiable
