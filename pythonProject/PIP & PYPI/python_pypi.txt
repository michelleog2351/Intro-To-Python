# Python Package Index (pypi) & pip

# Even though python standard library is comprehensive and has so many modules for common tasks, it is far from complete

***********************************************************
# pypi.org
# Python developers publish their packages so that other people can use and don't need to build everything from scratch

# web scraping: You can build an engine, and it can browse a website and extract information from HDML files
# This is the same technique that Google does to index various websites
# They have several engines/web crawlers which are continuously looking at websites and extracting information from their pages

# E.g. when you publish a blog post, Google's web crawler finds the title of your post and its keywords

***********************************************************
# pip is the tool that comes with a python installation
# We use it to install or uninstall packages registered on pypi.org

# Open up the Project Panel
# Expand External Libraries
# Next, expand python 3
# Expand site packages: This is where all the packages (and sub-packages) that we installed with pip are stored
# Here we can see various folders each containing the __init__.py file
# When a folder contains this file it is treated as a package
# Each folder also contains a list of modules
