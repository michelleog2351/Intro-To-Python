# First Django Project


# Fast, scalable and secure
# A framework is a library of reusable modules (building blocks)
# These modules provide functionality for common tasks
# Eg. to work with http requests, urls, sessions, cookies etc..

# A framework also defines a structure for our applications
# It tells us what folders and files we should have in our project - providing a consistency among various Django projects
