# Files and Directories
# On the python3 module index, we have a module called...
# pathlib: Object-oriented filesystem paths
# Meaning that this module provides classes that we can use to create objects to work with directories and files

# Now we need to create a path object to reference a file or directory on our computer

# Absolute path: starting from the root (of the hard disk)
# Eg: Windows c:\Program Files\Microsoft
# Mac or Linux /usr/local/bin

# Relative path: starting from the current directory and go somewhere else
from pathlib import Path

# Create a path object and pass a string (we can add a file/directory in this case)

path = Path("ecommerce")

# We can check to see if a path exists and this returns a Boolean value
print(path.exists())

# We can create a new directory by calling the mkdir method
# This method returns None which means it doesn't return any values.
# We should the directory now in the project panel
path = Path("emails")
# print(path.mkdir())

# To remove this directory, we call the rmdir method
# And "None" is returned again
print(path.rmdir())

# We can also find all the files and directories in a given path eg. a program to automate something,
# For example, you can iterate over all the spreadsheets in a directory, open them and process them


*******************************************************************************
Example:
from pathlib import Path

path = Path()
# With this method, we can search for files and directories in your current path
# In the first argument we need to pass a string that defines a search pattern
# An asterisk includes everything, all files and all directories
# We can optionally add an extension "*.*" or "*.py"
print(path.glob("*"))
print(path.glob("*.py"))

# We can iterate or loop through generator objects,
# So instead of printing them let's iterate over using a for loop

path = Path()
for file in path.glob("*"):
    print(file)

# To get all the files in the current directory
path = Path()
for file in path.glob("*.*"):
    print(file)

# All Python files in the current directory
path = Path()
for file in path.glob("*.py"):
    print(file)

# All Excel spreadsheets
path = Path()
for file in path.glob("*.py"):
    print(file)
