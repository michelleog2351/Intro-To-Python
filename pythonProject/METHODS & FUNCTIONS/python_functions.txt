# FUNCTIONS
# A function is a container for a few lines of code that perform a specific task
# Some of the built-in Python functions include print() and input()
# When building large complex programs, we should break up our code into smaller reusable chunks
# Functions better organise our code.

# Let's write a simple program for printing simple messages
# Put these messages in a function that we can reuse in other programs
# def is a reserved keyword in Python. Short for define
# When Python interpreter sees this, it knows that we are defining a function
# Give function a name using meaningful description
# Whenever we call this "greet_user" function, these two messages will be printed
# Squiggly line: After defining a function; we need to add two linebreaks after it
# This is coming from "pep8" which is a document that outlines the best practices for formatting our code

# Order of the code matters
# We need to define the function first not call first, otherwise there will be errors

def greet_user():
    print("Hi there!")
    print("Welcome aboard")


print("Start")
greet_user()
print("Finish")
