# RETURN STATEMENT
# How to create function that returns values

# Define a function called square (calculates the square of a number)
# Calculating number * number will help you find the square of a number
# To return this number outside this function; we simply use the return statement
# Now we can return values to the callers of our square function

# def square(number):
#    return number * number


# result = square(3)
# print(result)

# We can also just pass the function called directly inside the print function without defining a separate variable
# The value is passed as an argument to the print function
# This is useful for producing shorter code
def square(number):
    return number * number


print(square(3))

# By default, all Python functions return None (if there is no return statement)
# None is an object that represents the absence of a value
