# TUPLES
# They are similar to lists, so we can use them to store a list of items,
# But unlike lists, we cannot modify/add new items/remove existing items
# Tuples are immutable (unchanging over time or unable to be changed)
# We can't mutate/alter them

# Define a list of numbers
# We use square brackets to define lists and parenthesis to define tuples

# numbers.

# If we use the dot operator (as in lists to see the available methods), we see that there are only two methods.
# The count method and index method
# We use the count method to count the number of occurrences in an item
# The index method: to find the index of the first occurrence of the item
# We can only get information about the tuples we cannot change them

# To get the first item
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
print(numbers[0])
# However, if we try to change an item, we will get an error
# numbers[0] = 10
# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

# If you want to create a list and want to make sure you don't accidentally modify the program,
# it is better to use a tuple
