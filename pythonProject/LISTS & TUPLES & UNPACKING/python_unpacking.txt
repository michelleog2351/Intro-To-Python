# UNPACKING
# Define a tuple (x, y, z)
coordinates = (1, 2, 3)
# x = coordinates[0]
# y = coordinates[1]
# z = coordinates[2]

# Unpacking feature

# When python interpreter sees this statement,
# It will get the first item (1) in this tuple and assign it to the first variable (x)
# Then it will get the second item (2 )and assign it to the second variable (y) and the same for the third.
# Hence, we are unpacking this tuple into 3 variables
x, y, z = coordinates
print(x, y, z)

# We can use this feature in lists as well
# coordinates = [1, 2, 3]
# x, y, z = coordinates
# print(x, y, z)
