# Nested Loops
# Adding one loop inside another loop
# Makes it easy to generate a list of coordinates
# (x, y)
# (0, 0)
# (0, 1)
# (0, 2)
# (1, 0)
# (1, 1)
# (1, 2)
# A coordinate is a combination of an x and y value

# Start with one loop
# With this loop we can generate values for the x coordinate
# (0, 1, 2, 3)
for x in range(4):
    print(x)

# Now, for each x value i.e. 0, we should generate a y value
# Inside the for loop, add another loop
# Use a formatted string to display the coordinates

# First iteration on line 1 (outer loop), x is 0
for x in range(4):
    # First iteration on line 2 (inner loop), y is 0
    for y in range(3):
        # (0, 0) will be printed on the terminal
        print(f"({x}, {y})")
# The control goes back to the inner loop, in this second iteration y will be incremented to 1.
# But we are still in the first iteration of outer loop
# Therefore, x is still 0

# (0, 1) will now be printed on the terminal
# This process continues until the inner loop is completed
# The same process repeats when x = 1

# Challenge: make an F shape using x's

numbers = [5, 2, 5, 2, 2]

# First we need to iterate over all the items in this list
# "x_count" represents the number of x's on each line

for x_count in numbers:

    # Initially set output variable to an empty string
    output = " "

    # Use the range function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 up to x_count variable
    # In the first iteration, x_count is going to be 5
    # So, range of 5 will generate the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    # Inner loop will be executed 5 times

    for count in range(x_count):
        # We need to append an "x" to our output variable
